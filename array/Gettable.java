    // In production environment we read this array from User (use Scanner), in test environment we get it as random array
    // or use an array defined in the code. So, you need to implement a method getArray() witch as argument takes the way,
    // how the array will be created and as a result returns the array. Implement this program
    // (hint: use knowledge about interface)
    int[] getArray();
